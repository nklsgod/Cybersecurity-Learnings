# Security in Computing Environments – In Depth

## Core Security Goals

1. Prevent unauthorized access
2. Limit damage after access
3. Recover systems and data

## Prevent – Gateway Security

- Firewalls separate trusted from untrusted networks
- Cloud environments lack a clear physical perimeter
- Identity and policy become central security controls

## Contain – Segregation & Zero Standing Access

- Access to one area must not imply access to all
- Zero Standing Access: no permanent production access

### Key Concepts

- Just-In-Time (JIT): time-limited access
- Just-Enough-Access (JEA): minimal required privileges

## Recover – Backups & Resilience

- On-Prem: 3-2-1 backup strategy required
- Cloud: virtualization, automated backups, geo-redundancy
- Recovery planning is mandatory regardless of environment

## Key Takeaway

Effective security strategies combine prevention, containment, and recovery.
